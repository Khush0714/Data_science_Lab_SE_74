        "The expert system functions as a movie recommendation engine that takes user input for their current mood and the time of day. Its decision-making process is rule-based, applying a set of predefined `if-elif` rules to match the user's input with a specific movie genre recommendation. If no specific rule is met, it provides a default message indicating that no specific recommendation could be found for that combination.\n",

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The `get_user_input` function effectively gathers user mood and time of day, ensuring data integrity by validating inputs against predefined lists of valid moods (e.g., 'happy', 'sad', 'adventurous', 'relaxed', 'excited', 'thoughtful', 'scared') and times (e.g., 'morning', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'night').\n",
        "*   The `recommend_movie` inference engine successfully applies the 7 predefined rules:\n",
        "    *   A 'happy' mood in the 'evening' recommends 'Comedy'.\n",
        "    *   A 'sad' mood at 'night' recommends 'Drama or Comfort Movie'.\n",
        "    *   An 'adventurous' mood in the 'afternoon' recommends 'Action/Adventure'.\n",
        "    *   A 'relaxed' mood in the 'morning' recommends 'Documentary or Light Drama'.\n",
        "    *   An 'excited' mood in the 'evening' recommends 'Thriller or Action'.\n",
        "    *   A 'thoughtful' mood, regardless of the time of day, recommends 'Mystery or Sci-Fi'.\n",
        "    *   A 'scared' mood at 'night' recommends 'Horror (for brave souls) OR Animated Family (to counter fear)'.\n",
        "*   The system correctly handles scenarios where no specific rule matches the input, providing a default message: \"I couldn't find a specific recommendation for your mood and time combination.\" This was confirmed for combinations like 'happy' in the 'morning' or 'scared' in the 'afternoon'.\n",
        "*   All test cases, covering every predefined rule and various default scenarios, passed successfully, validating the system's logic and expected behavior.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   To enhance the system's utility, the rule base could be expanded to cover more mood and time combinations, providing a recommendation for every possible valid input.\n",
        "*   Consider incorporating additional user preferences, such as preferred genres, directors, or actors, to offer more personalized and nuanced movie suggestions.\n"
